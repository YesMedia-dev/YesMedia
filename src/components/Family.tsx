The staff was also very much involved and willing to give her all the answers that she needed on top of the Physical Therapy that she said was the best she had ever received, her physical therapy was customized for her needs for the areas of her body that needed to be strengthened. She said she was very happy with this facility. And would happily return if she needed this type of therapy.",
